Tested in Developer mode of: Version 123.0.6312.90 (Official Build, ungoogled-chromium) (64-bit)

Unpacked with Ubuntu Mint archive manager, replaced all images with 1x1 pixel png, heavily modified style.css included original.

I make a lot of scripts so I required a notepad-like screen without accidentally clicking facebook links and various other elements.

Includes my script for Stumblechat.com to directly read the websocket chat log

the menu really should be fully done away with as CTRL + S is all you need to save. if your script doesnt work, click the invisible 'on' button which doesnt change if enabled or disabled
