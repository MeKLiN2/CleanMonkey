# CleanMonkey

A modification to Tampermonkey

Tested in Developer mode of: Version 123.0.6312.90 (Official Build, ungoogled-chromium) (64-bit)


Unpacked from: https://data.tampermonkey.net/tampermonkey_beta.crx


with Ubuntu Mint archive manager, replaced all images with 1x1 pixel png, heavily modified style.css included original.


I make a lot of scripts so I required a notepad-like screen without accidentally clicking facebook links and various other elements.
